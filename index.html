<h1>What's going on with NYC congestion pricing?</h1>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul has announced an intention to "indefinitely pause" the scheduled rollout of congestion pricing on June 30. Here's how it affects you and how you can get involved in the effort to save congestion pricing.</p>
<h2>Contact your elected officials</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Call the governor's office</b> at 518-474-8390. If you can, try to speak with someone (option 2) - but expect hold times to be long! If you aren't sure what to say, <a href="https://action.ridersalliance.org/emergency-call-6524/">use this nifty tool from Riders Alliance</a> to get talking points.</li>
<li><b>Call your state legislators</b>. Find your <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/find-my-senator">senator</a> and <a href="https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/mem/search/">assemblymember</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://bit.ly/HochulHatesTheMTA">Send a letter to the governor, the MTA board, and your legislators</a></b>, courtesy NYC-DSA Ecosocialists.</li>
